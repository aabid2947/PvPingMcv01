Project Documentation: Static Website Deployment Using React

1. Project Overview
The project is about building a clean, responsive static website for PvPing with six main pages. The site will be hosted on Cloudflare Pages and have:

- Home Page: A specially designed landing page showcasing the three newest blog posts.
- Blog Overview Page: A page with a list of all published blog posts.
- Blog Detail Page: Dynamic pages which render single blog posts authored in Markdown.
- Store Page: A page which includes integration with Tebex's Headless API to retrieve product packages and process payment.
- Vote Page: A basic page redirecting visitors to an external voting platform.
- Rules Page: A page which replicates the rules content from https://oplegends.com/rules.

2. Tech Stack
The project takes advantage of React and surrounding technologies to have a quick, interactive, and easy-to-maintain website:

Frontend Framework:
- React: For creating a dynamic and component-based UI.

Routing & Static Generation:
- React Router: To handle routing between pages.
- Static Site Generation: The project will be constructed as a static site, with pages pre-rendered for quick load times on Cloudflare Pages.

Styling:
- Tailwind CSS: For responsive and fast UI building.

Markdown Rendering:
- react-markdown: To render Markdown blog posts as React components after parsing them.

Store Integration:
- Tebex Headless API: Accessed through fetch/axios to get product packages and handle payments. The integration will be in line with the Tebex documentation guidelines.

Version Control & Collaboration:
- Git & GitHub: For collaboration and source code management.

Deployment:
- Cloudflare Pages: To host the static website, providing secure HTTPS and fast global content delivery.

3. Implementation Process

### 3.1. Planning & Design
Requirements Gathering:
- Visit through all the reference sites provided (home, blog, blog detail, store, vote, and rules) to grasp the functionality needed.
- Complete the site design, making sure the home page has a clear appearance but prominently displays the three most recent blog posts.

Design :
- Obtain client's figma design and inmplement it.

### 3.2. Project Setup
Initialize Project:
- Initialize a new React project (using Create React App or a similar boilerplate).
- Add Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Set up a Git repository on GitHub for version control.

Folder Structure:
- Structure the project in components, pages, and assets.
- Establish routing via React Router or file-based routing from Next.js if chosen.

### 3.3. Page Building
Home Page:
- Build a distinct layout that is not the same as the reference site.
- Add a module/component to retrieve and show the three most recent blog posts. Blog content can be handled as static JSON files or imported from Markdown files at build time.

Blog Pages:
- Blog Overview Page: Establish a page listing all blog entries. Use pagination or infinite scrolling if necessary.
- Blog Detail Page: Establish dynamic routing such that each blog entry (in Markdown format) is routed to a detail page. Employ react-markdown to render Markdown content as React components.

Store Page:
- Establish integration with the Tebex Headless API to retrieve product packages.
- Utilize the Tebex Headless Template as a reference to handle payments and show store products.
- Handle API keys and payment information securely.

Vote Page:
- Build a basic page with an easy-to-understand call-to-action button or link that redirects visitors to the external voting site.

Rules Page:
- Build a static page that replicates the rules given by the client directly.
- Maintain uniform styling with the rest of the website.

### 3.4. Testing & Quality Assurance
Unit & Integration Testing:
- Test React components with a framework like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Ensure API integrations, particularly with the Tebex API, are properly functioning.

Responsive & Cross-Browser Testing:
- Test the site on different devices and browsers for responsiveness and compatibility.

Performance Optimization:
- Optimize images, code splitting, and asset delivery for quick load times on Cloudflare Pages.

### 3.5. Deployment
Staging Environment:
- Integrate the GitHub repository with Cloudflare Pages and deploy to a staging environment.
- Provide the staging URL to the client for review and feedback.

Final Production Deployment:
- Deploy the final build to production once approved.
- Keep an eye on performance and configure alerts for any post-deployment problems.

4. Deliverables
- Static Website: A complete static website with six pages: Home, Blog Overview, Blog Detail, Store, Vote, and Rules.
- Blog System: A blogging system based on Markdown for simple content management.
- Store Integration: Direct integration with Tebex's Headless API for real-time product rendering and payment handling.
- Source Code: Source code for the entire project hosted on GitHub.
- Deployment: Website hosted and deployed on Cloudflare Pages with continuous integration set up.
- Documentation: Thorough documentation of design choices, implementation specifics, API usage, and maintenance practices.

5. Post-Launch Support & Maintenance
- Support Period: Offer support for post-launch bug fixes, content modifications, and small tweaks.
- Documentation Handover: Provide extensive documentation to aid in future maintenance and updates.
- Client Training: Provide training on how to update blog posts via Markdown and edit other site content as an option.

6. Conclusion
The above project document specifies a concrete plan for creating the  static website utilizing React for the frontend.
 The use of a Markdown-based blog system, native store integration through the Tebex Headless API, and hosting on Cloudflare 
 Pages guarantees a up-to-date, scalable, and manageable solution. The timeline and milestones ensure transparency to the client, with each step being well-planned and implemented. We guarantee a high-quality, user-friendly website that fully satisfies all project requirements.
