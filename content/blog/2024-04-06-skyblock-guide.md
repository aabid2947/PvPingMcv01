# Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Skyblock

![Skyblock Island](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PvPingMc/blog-images/main/skyblock.jpg)

Welcome to our comprehensive guide to Skyblock! Whether you're completely new to the game mode or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to succeed in our Skyblock server.

## What is Skyblock?

Skyblock is a popular Minecraft game mode where players spawn on a small floating island with limited resources. The challenge is to survive and thrive by carefully managing and expanding these resources. Our server features a unique take on the classic Skyblock experience with custom islands, challenges, and progression.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your Island

To begin your Skyblock adventure:

1. Join our server at `play.originmc.net`
2. Type `/skyblock` or `/is` in the chat
3. Choose an island template (Standard, Desert, Snowy, or Jungle)
4. Invite friends (optional) with `/is invite [player]`

### Your Starter Kit

All new players receive:

- 1x Ice Block
- 1x Lava Bucket
- 1x Water Bucket
- 2x Oak Saplings
- 2x Bone Meal
- 1x Pumpkin Seed
- 1x Melon Seed
- 6x Dirt Blocks
- 1x Sugar Cane

### First Steps (Day 1)

Here's what you should focus on during your first day:

1. **Create a Cobblestone Generator**
   - Place the water and lava with at least one block between them
   - The meeting point will generate cobblestone

2. **Expand Your Island**
   - Mine cobblestone to expand your platform
   - Create a 5x5 area for initial farming

3. **Grow Your Tree**
   - Plant one sapling with space around it
   - Use bone meal to speed up growth
   - Collect wood, replant saplings immediately

4. **Create a Basic Farm**
   - Use dirt blocks to create a small farm
   - Plant seeds and sugar cane
   - Build it near your water source

## Resource Management

### Infinite Resources

These resources can be generated infinitely:

- **Cobblestone**: From your generator
- **Wood**: From replanting trees
- **Crops**: From replanting seeds
- **Water**: Using a bucket on your water source

### Limited Resources

Be careful with these resources until you unlock more:

- **Dirt**: Used for farming
- **Sand**: Used for glass and concrete
- **Initial Seeds**: Until you can harvest more

## Island Expansion

### Expanding Your Platform

Strategically expand your island in this order:

1. Larger tree farm (at least 4 trees)
2. Basic mob farm for drops
3. Expanded crop area
4. Storage system
5. Animal pens

### Height Levels

Utilize different height levels for efficiency:

- **Y-Level 64-70**: Main operations and storage
- **Y-Level 71-80**: Tree and crop farming
- **Y-Level 50-60**: Mob farming
- **Y-Level 40-50**: Resource generation systems

## Advanced Farming Techniques

### Crop Automation

Once you have enough resources, build semi-automatic farms:

1. **Water Harvesting System**:
   - Create a 9x9 farm with water in the center
   - Place a slab over the water source
   - Install a button/lever connected to a dispenser with water bucket

### Mob Farming

For a basic mob farm:

1. Build a platform 24+ blocks away from your island
2. Create a 9x9 dark chamber
3. Add water channels flowing to a central collection point
4. Create a safe AFK spot to let mobs spawn

## Island Challenges

Complete challenges to earn rewards and progress:

1. Open the challenge menu with `/challenges`
2. Start with the "Beginner" category
3. Complete challenges in order for best progression
4. Redeem rewards immediately to help with other challenges

### Key Beginner Challenges

- **Lumberjack**: Chop 16 oak logs
- **Stone Age**: Mine 64 cobblestone
- **Green Thumb**: Harvest 16 wheat
- **Fisher**: Catch 10 fish
- **Rancher**: Breed 2 cows

## Island Levels and Ranking

Your island has a level based on the blocks and items it contains:

- Rarer blocks and items add more value
- Higher level islands appear higher on the leaderboard
- Unlock special perks at certain level milestones

Check your island level with `/is level`.

## Island Settings and Protection

### Basic Commands

- `/is home`: Teleport to your island
- `/is settings`: Adjust island settings
- `/is ban [player]`: Ban a player from your island
- `/is kick [player]`: Remove a player from your island
- `/is trust [player]`: Allow a player to build on your island
- `/is untrust [player]`: Remove building privileges

### Island Permissions

Control what visitors can do on your island:

1. Open settings with `/is settings`
2. Toggle options like:
   - Allow animal breeding
   - Allow crop harvesting
   - Allow PvP
   - Allow mob killing

## Economy and Trading

### Island Shop

Access the shop with `/shop` to:

- Sell excess resources
- Buy items you can't produce yet
- Trade with other players

### Player Shops

Once you reach Island Level 10, you can create your own shop:

1. Place a chest
2. Hold an item you want to sell
3. Use `/shop create [buy price] [sell price]`
4. Click on the chest to create the shop

## Advanced Tips

- **Nether Access**: Unlocks at Island Level 15
- **Spawners**: Can be purchased after completing all medium challenges
- **Island Upgrades**: Buy upgrades like larger island size and higher member limit in `/is upgrades`
- **Minions**: Automatic resource gatherers unlocked at Level 25

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Losing Limited Resources**: Never throw lava, water, or dirt into the void
2. **Poor Planning**: Plan your island layout before expanding
3. **Neglecting Challenges**: They provide crucial resources and progression
4. **Ignoring Community**: Trading with others can help you progress faster
