# Halloween Special Event: Spooky Survival Challenge

Get ready for the most thrilling event of the year! Our Halloween Special Event is launching on **October 25th** and will run through **November 1st**. The entire server has been transformed into a haunted realm filled with ghosts, zombies, and other creatures of the night.

## Event Features

### ðŸŽƒ Haunted Zones

We've created several specially designed haunted zones throughout the map:

- **Witch's Forest**: Navigate through a dense, fog-covered forest filled with hostile witches and their cauldrons.
- **Graveyard of the Forgotten**: An ancient cemetery where skeletons rise from their graves.
- **Haunted Manor**: A massive haunted house with multiple floors, secrets, and scary surprises.
- **Pumpkin Fields**: Seemingly peaceful pumpkin patches that hide dangerous monsters.

### ðŸ‘» Special Challenges

Complete these challenges to earn Halloween Tokens:

1. **Ghost Hunter**: Defeat 50 ghosts that spawn randomly across the map
2. **Pumpkin Carver**: Collect and carve 25 special pumpkins
3. **Candy Collector**: Find hidden candy chests throughout all zones
4. **Costume Contest**: Create the best Halloween-themed skin and win by community vote
5. **Mansion Escape**: Find your way out of the procedurally generated haunted mansion

### ðŸ¦‡ Exclusive Rewards

Spend your Halloween Tokens on these limited-time items:

- **Grim Reaper's Scythe**: A powerful weapon with a unique ability to harvest souls
- **Ghost Costume**: A translucent skin overlay that makes you partially invisible
- **Pet Bat**: A companion that follows you and helps detect nearby ores
